        Think like a man of action and act like man of thought.
            Courage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.
            Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.
            By doubting we come at the truth.

        We give advice, but we cannot give conduct.
        Nature never deceives us; it is always we who deceive ourselves.
        Forgiveness is better than revenge.
        We never know the worth of water till the well is dry.
        Pain past is pleasure.
