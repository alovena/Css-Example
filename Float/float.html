        Think like a man of action and act like man of thought.
            Courage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.
            Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.
            By doubting we come at the truth.
            A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others
            When money speaks, the truth keeps silent.

                    We give advice, but we cannot give conduct.
            Nature never deceives us; it is always we who deceive ourselves.
            Forgiveness is better than revenge.
            We never know the worth of water till the well is dry.
            Pain past is pleasure.
            Books are ships which pass through the vast seas of time.
            Who begins too much accomplishes little.
            Better the last smile than the first laughter.
            Faith is a higher faculty than reason.
            Until the day of his death, no man can be sure of his courage.
            Great art is an instant arrested in eternity.
